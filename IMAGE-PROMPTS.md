### Generation Tips:
1. Use the full prompt as written for consistency
2. If the AI generator has difficulty with complexity, break into two passes:
   - First: Generate the basic workshop scene with lighting
   - Second: Add specific thematic elements (printing press, mirrors, etc.)
3. Maintain consistent lighting and color palette across all images
4. The mood should be contemplative, not desolate
5. Balance clutter with composition—should feel lived-in, not chaotic

## Testing Your Images

After generating images:
1. Place all images in `public/assets/` folder
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Check each page to ensure images load and fit properly
4. Verify images work on mobile (responsive test)
5. Ensure file sizes are optimized (compress if needed)

For best results, maintain visual consistency across all images while allowing each to reflect its chapter's unique theme.
