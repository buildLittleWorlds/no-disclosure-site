            This chapter systematically dismantles the romanticized myth of the solitary author, arguing that creative production has
            always been a far more collaborative and complex endeavor than is commonly believed.

          <h2>The Myth of Solitary Authorship</h2>
          <p>
            Even sacred texts like the Bible were often the product of dictation to anonymous scribesâ€”a historical reality that undermines
            contemporary demands for absolute transparency in AI-assisted authorship. By tracing the history of creation through medieval
            scriptoria, Renaissance workshops, and Enlightenment literary salons, the chapter demonstrates that collaboration is not a new
            phenomenon but a long-standing tradition.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            The modern anxiety that AI-generated writing is "soulless" or "inauthentic" is an echo of past discomfort with technological
            disruptions, overlooking the fact that authorship has always been an intricate dance of influences, collaborations, and intermediaries.

          <h2>The Practice of Dictated Authorship</h2>
          <p>
            The historical practice of dictated authorship is examined in detail, revealing that figures like the Apostle Paul relied on
            scribes not merely as transcribers but as creative partners who helped shape the final text. Similarly, scribes in ancient
            Egypt and Rome acted as co-authors, refining language and shaping messages for cultural resonance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chapter argues that generative tools like ChatGPT are modern-day digital scribes, continuing this long tradition of mediated creativity.

          <h2>The Shift in Authorial Roles</h2>
          <p>
            In the age of AI, writing has become a mediated collaboration rather than a solitary act. The traditional, linear writing
            process is being augmented, with the author's role evolving from that of a sole creator to an orchestrator who guides and
            curates machine-generated content.
          </p>
          <p>
            This new dynamic is analyzed through the lens of Michel Foucault's "author-function," which reframes the author as a social
            construct. With AI, the author-function is no longer exclusively human but extends to algorithms and digital intermediaries.

        <section>
          <h2>From Execution to Ideation</h2>
          <p>
            As AI automates the labor-intensive tasks of writing (the "execution"), the human contribution increasingly lies in the
            conceptual realm of ideas, curation, and editing. This trend challenges the foundations of copyright law, which has
            historically protected tangible expression rather than abstract ideas.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            The human author's new role is to serve as the "Last Mile" arbiter, providing the crucial final stamp of credibility and accountability.
