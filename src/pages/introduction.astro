            The introduction establishes the book's central thesis against the mandatory disclosure of AI use in creative works.
            It draws a historical parallel between current anxieties surrounding artificial intelligence and the disruption caused
            by Johannes Gutenberg's printing press.

          <h2>The Historical Parallel</h2>
          <p>
            Just as 15th-century traditionalists feared texts not painstakingly copied by monks, modern critics of AI demand meticulous
            transparency, treating the creative process as a formula to be audited. The book argues this demand is not only historically
            unprecedented but also fundamentally at odds with the inherently opaque and messy nature of creativity.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            True authorship lies not in a detailed log of methods but in a creator's willingness to take responsibility for the final
            product, irrespective of its origins.
          </blockquote>

          <h2>The Myth of Disclosure</h2>
          <p>
            The text introduces the "myth of disclosure," framing the debate around generative AI as a conflict over control, not just
            transparency. While skeptics present a simple binary of human originality versus machine imitation, the authors contend the
            real issue is an institutional desire to police creativity—a desire that misunderstands that creative power often stems from
            hidden and even inscrutable sources.

        <section>
          <h2>Legal Complexities Emerging</h2>
          <p>
            The introduction highlights the legal complexities already emerging, citing the case of Kris Kashtanova's graphic novel
            <em>Zarya of the Dawn</em>, where copyright was granted for the human-written narrative but denied for the AI-generated images.
            This is contrasted with the 2025 copyrighting of Kent Keirsey's <em>A Slice of American Cheese</em>, which was approved only
            after the artist exhaustively documented 34 distinct verbal instructions given to the AI, thereby complicating the very definition
            of "human creativity."
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Creative Process Through History</h2>
          <p>
            To define the "creative process," the chapter traces historical perspectives, from Plato's dialogue <em>Ion</em> to Renaissance
            ideas of "poetic furor" and the practices of modern surrealists. Artists and writers throughout history, from Salvador Dalí to
            Ernest Hemingway, have embraced methods that deliberately circumvent rational control, demonstrating the historical importance
            of opacity in achieving creative authenticity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The modern demand for precise documentation of AI use is presented as a baffling reversal of this long-standing tradition.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The New Creativity Economy</h2>
          <p>
            The rise of generative AI is seen as disrupting the paradigm of the solitary genius, moving creativity toward a collaborative
            model where humans and algorithms work together. This shift does not diminish creativity but expands it, fostering a new
            "creativity economy" where skills such as ideation and curation become paramount.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            The insistence on AI disclosure is a profound misunderstanding of both historical precedent and the intrinsic nature of
            creative thought.
