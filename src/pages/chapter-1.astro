            This chapter directly confronts and deconstructs the argument that creators must fully disclose their use of generative AI.
            It contends that such demands are not only impractical but fundamentally incompatible with the chaotic, intuitive, and often
            subconscious nature of the creative process.

          <h2>Historical Precedents: Photography and Painting</h2>
          <p>
            The chapter opens with an analogy, comparing the current panic over AI to the anxiety 19th-century painters felt with the
            invention of photography. The idea of forcing those artists to meticulously document their photographic techniques seems
            absurd today, yet this is precisely the kind of scrutiny proponents of transparency now demand from creators using generative tools.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            While proponents argue that disclosure is an ethical necessity to distinguish human from machine and prevent plagiarism,
            the chapter frames this as a "comforting illusion" that dangerously misunderstands creativity itself.

          <h2>The Irony of Documentation</h2>
          <p>
            The chapter emphasizes the irony of mandatory disclosure through the case of Kent Keirsey's <em>A Slice of American Cheese</em>,
            which was granted copyright only after the creator documented every minor prompt and command given to the AI. This shifts the
            focus from artistic skill to the procedural act of guiding a machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            This irony is compounded by the fact that generative tools are becoming so deeply integrated into everyday software that
            <em>avoiding</em> their use requires more conscious effort than using them.

          <h2>Absent Presence</h2>
          <p>
            The text introduces the concept of "Absent Presence" to argue that AI-generated works are far from "soulless." Just as an
            absent character can powerfully influence a story, the vast archives of human-authored texts and images used to train AI
            models imbue their outputs with a spectral but undeniable human influence.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Absurdity of Exhaustive Documentation</h2>
          <p>
            To illustrate the absurdity of exhaustive documentation, the chapter satirically imagines a traditional academic being forced
            to log every conversation, Google search, and grammar correction that contributed to their research. Applying this same
            standard to AI use reveals its unfeasibility and its corrosive effect on genuine scholarship.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Creative work has always been judged by the final product's impact and resonance, not by a detailed audit of its creation.

          <h2>Cultural Resistance to Technology</h2>
          <p>
            The historical resistance to technological change is presented as a recurring pattern of cultural anxiety. From ancient Greek
            automata to modern AI, new technologies that mimic human abilities have consistently provoked existential unease. This
            resistance is framed not as an ethical stance but as a cultural prejudice rooted in the fear of losing power, control, and
            a sense of human exceptionalism.
