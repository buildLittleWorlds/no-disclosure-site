            This chapter argues that the stringent transparency demands imposed by publishers and academic institutions represent a form
            of overreach that threatens creative autonomy in the age of generative AI.

          <h2>The Central Paradox</h2>
          <p>
            A central paradox emerges: AI-assisted work is often praised for its quality when its origins are concealed but is frequently
            rejected once its algorithmic assistance is disclosed. This reveals a deep-seated institutional bias against technological
            change that prioritizes traditional methods over intellectual merit.
          </p>

          <h2>The Rise of Algorithmic Authorship</h2>
          <p>
            AI is streamlining the entire academic publication process, from topic modeling and literature reviews to citation management
            and peer review. AI-assisted peer review is presented as a potential solution to a system plagued by bias and fatigue.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this rise in efficiency has triggered "Authority Anxiety" among established institutions.

          <h2>The Modern Scopes Trial</h2>
          <p>
            The chapter draws a compelling parallel to the 1925 Scopes "Monkey Trial," framing the current debate as a modern-day struggle
            between institutional control and intellectual freedom. Just as that trial debated who should control educational curricula,
            today's conflict centers on who has the authority to define legitimate creative methodologies.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Just as the Scopes Trial questioned who controls knowledge, today we ask: who has the authority to dictate how creativity
            should be practiced?
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Current Policy Landscape</h2>
          <p>
            The chapter provides a comprehensive overview of current AI policies across publishing, news, and academia. Academic publishers
            like <em>Nature</em> and Elsevier have developed guidelines that permit AI assistance for tasks like improving readability but
            firmly place accountability on the human author.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trade publishers like Penguin Random House have taken a more defensive stance, championing human-only creation, while news
            organizations such as <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>Reuters</em> have adopted cautious policies that mandate transparency
            and strict human oversight.

          <h2>From Restriction to Responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            The chapter concludes by advocating for a move "From Restriction to Responsibility." It points to legal frameworks like the
            U.S. fair-use doctrine as models for allowing innovation while protecting creators.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            We need balanced policies that guide rather than restrict AI use, fostering a culture of ethical experimentation that
            recognizes AI as a powerful tool in the creative toolkit, not a threat to be contained.
