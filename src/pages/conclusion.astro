            The conclusion delivers a forceful and final argument for a creator's right to methodological opacity, directly challenging
            the widespread ethical assumption that creators are obligated to disclose their processes.

          <h2>A Radical Reframing</h2>
          <p>
            The chapter proposes a radical reframing: creative methods, whether they involve generative AI or traditional techniques,
            should remain the exclusive and private domain of the creator. Mandatory disclosure is not only ethically questionable but
            also practically impossible in a world saturated with AI-driven tools.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            The demand for granular documentation to "prove" purely human authorship is dismissed as a performative ritual.
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Toward a New Ethics of Creative Freedom</h2>
          <p>
            The chapter summarizes the book's central argument that the institutional demand for transparency is an intrusion that
            undermines the autonomy essential for creativity. It reiterates that creative work has never been fully transparent and has
            always involved hidden processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            To impose disclosure mandates now, simply because AI is involved, is a "selective ethics born out of suspicion and discomfort."
            The chapter champions "ethical opacity," a framework that trusts creators to manage their own methodologies and shifts the
            focus of evaluation from the process to the product.

          <h2>The Future of Authorship in the AI Era</h2>
          <p>
            The advent of generative AI is framed as an irreversible transformation of the creative landscape. The emotional reactions
            against AI are understood as stemming from deep-seated fears about human displacement, identity, and value rather than from
            objective ethical reasoning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book argues that the future of authorship must move beyond a simple "human-versus-machine" binary and toward hybridized
            modes of creation—"centaur and cyborg collaborations"—that extend, rather than threaten, human capabilities.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Full Autonomy Over Methods</h2>
          <blockquote>
            Creators must have full autonomy over their methods. Accountability is found in the integrity of the final work, not in an
            exhaustive audit of its creation.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The future of authorship in the AI era requires moving away from policing methods and toward evaluating products, an approach
            that is presented as the only sustainable path forward.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Final Invitation</h2>
          <p>
            The final invitation is for creators, institutions, and readers to engage openly and fearlessly with a world in which
            creativity itself is evolving, envisioning a future where humans and machines collaborate not as competitors but as co-creators.
