## Recommendations for Remaining Images

When generating the other 6 images for the site, maintain:

- **Dominant colors**: Deep browns (#2a1810), sepia tones (#3d2817)
- **Highlights**: Warm amber (#e6b054), lamplight gold (#f5d98a)
- **Midtones**: Warm beige (#d9c7a8), muted gold (#c9a567)

### Lighting consistency:
- Single warm light source (candle/lantern) in each scene
- Golden glow on focal points
- Deep shadows in corners and edges
- Reflective surfaces (puddles, wet floors) catching light

### Atmospheric elements:
- Heavy crosshatching in shadows
- Muddy watercolor washes
- Aged, weathered surfaces
- Intimate, enclosed spaces
- Solitary but purposeful feeling (not lonely, but autonomous)

## Testing the Current Site

The development server is running. View your site at:
- http://localhost:4321

### Pages to check:
- `/` - Homepage with the wooded path hero image
- `/introduction` - Gothic interior with "Beyond Transparency"
- `/conclusion` - Private study sanctuary

### What to look for:
1. Text remains highly readable against dark backgrounds
2. Golden highlights complement the lamplight in images
3. Buttons and interactive elements have sufficient contrast
4. Overall mood is contemplative and atmospheric, not oppressive
5. Color transitions feel natural between image and page design

## Next Steps

1. **Generate remaining 6 images** using the updated palette
2. **Test accessibility** - ensure sufficient color contrast ratios
3. **Mobile optimization** - verify images work on smaller screens
4. **Performance** - compress images if needed (currently ~3MB each)

The site now has a cohesive, atmospheric aesthetic that matches the expressionist, candlelit workshop style of your AI-generated artwork.
